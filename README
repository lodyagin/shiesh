ShieSH (the Shielded Shell) server
==================================

The Shielded Shell is a port of Open SSH to
Windows operating system.

It contains sftp, shell (windows cmd) and port forwarding.

Why you may need it? Why not just use cygwin?

There are 2 reason that matters:
1. Security (cygwin has known conceptual holes)
2. Speed (cygwin doesn't use a windows native API but Open
SSH uses Unix fork extensively).

ShieSH use a dual license scheme. You may use it under the
terms of GPL. You also can contact me or Cohors LLC to get
a proprietary license.

ShieSH sftp is very fast and well-tested.
Shell has some glitches (windows specific) but usable. 
Port forwarding may need some optimization. 

Ulike other windows SSH implementations ShieSH use the
original Open SSH code but all unix-specific system calls
(like fork) are changed to use the Cohors Concurro C++
library (https://github.com/lodyagin/concurro). It brings
the same quality/strength as the original Open BSD SSH
server to ShieSH.

The latest versions of Concurro also works on Linux. So it
is possible to "port back" ShieSH to Linux and ever to
other systems that are not POSIX-based if write Concurro
port to that systems (e.g., realtime or exokernel).
